Grabbers

Overview:
    * Simple utility to demo reading and parsing PDFs to extract IOCs from reports

Libraries:
    * iocextract
    * PyPDF2

Limitations:
    * Some flakiness with regex parsing, but that can still be worked with

Currently only runs by scanning the example PDF hosted in this 
repository. Although it would be easy point it to another file.
